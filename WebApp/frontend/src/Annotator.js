The light that was last scattered about 380,000 years later, when the universe had become transparent, has been redshifted and is now seen as thermal radiation with a temperature of 2.7 K, the cosmic microwave background (CMB). However, since light escapes faster than matter can move, it is prudent to ask how we, made of matter from this very source, can still see the light. In order for this to be possible, the light must take a return path of the right length. A curved return path is possible in spatially closed, balloon-like models, but in standard cosmology, the universe is “flat” rather than balloon-like, and it lacks a boundary surface that might function as a reflector. Under these premises, radiation that once filled the universe homogeneously cannot do so permanently after expansion, and we cannot see the last scattering event. It is shown that the traditional calculation of the CMB temperature is inappropriate and that light emitted by any source inside the Big Bang universe earlier than half its “conformal age” can only become visible to us via a return path. Although often advanced as the best evidence for a hot Big Bang, the CMB actually tells against a formerly smaller universe and so do also distant galaxies.

        <div id="article1-body" class="generated-article-body"><h2 class="main-title" id="d25188e127">Introduction</h2><p class="" id="d25188e130">In 1964, <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-21">Penzias &amp; Wilson (1965)</a> serendipitously discovered the cosmic microwave background (CMB), a thermal radiation with a temperature of 2.7 K. Prior to this, the presence of a cosmic heat bath with a temperature of a few K had already been conjectured by several researchers on various grounds unrelated to the Big Bang (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-5">Assis &amp; Neves, 1995</a>). Based on absorption lines of interstellar CN-molecules, <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-15">McKellar (1940)</a> had suggested a maximum temperature of interstellar space of no more than 2.7 K. <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-2">Alpher &amp; Herman (1948)</a> and <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-1">Alpher <i>et al.</i> (1967)</a>, who were contemplating thermonuclear reactions in the expanding universe (for historical perspectives see <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-17">Naselsky <i>et al.</i> (2006)</a> and <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-4">Alpher (2012)</a>, expected a thermal radiation with about 5 K as a residual of a hot Big Bang. In this, they built on Tolman’s studies (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-29">Tolman, 1931</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-30">Tolman, 1934</a>) of model universes filled with blackbody radiation as a thermodynamic fluid, so that “<i>The model of the expanding universe with which we deal, then, is one containing a homogeneous, isotropic mixture of matter and blackbody radiation</i>” (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-3">Alpher &amp; Herman, 1975</a>). They did not really discuss and clarify under which conditions such a state is sustainable in Big Bang models.</p><p class="" id="d25188e173">When <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-21">Penzias &amp; Wilson (1965)</a> were bothered by the presence of unexpected radiation, another group of scientists (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-12">Dicke <i>et al.</i>, 1965</a>) did expect it in a hot Big Bang model and was developing an experiment in order to measure it. After asking whether the universe could have been filled with black-body radiation from its possible high-temperature state, they say “<i>If so, it is important to notice that as the universe expands the cosmological redshift would serve to adiabatically cool the radiation, while preserving the thermal character. The radiation temperature would vary inversely as the expansion parameter (radius) of the universe.</i>” This is also what <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-30">Tolman (1934)</a> said.</p><p class="" id="d25188e191"><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-12">Dicke <i>et al.</i> (1965)</a> were initially in favor of a model in which the universe expands, slows down and contracts to a minimal size (not necessarily a singularity), for a new cycle to begin, but they concluded that “<i>with the assumption of general relativity and a primordial temperature consistent with the present 3.5°K, we are forced to adopt an open space, with very low density.</i>” (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-12">Dicke <i>et al.</i>, 1965</a>). They had expected the temperature to exceed 30 K in a closed space.</p><p class="" id="d25188e208">In subsequent Big Bang models, the universe expanded from a very dense and opaque initial state in which it was filled with a hot and dense plasma consisting of protons, electrons and photons colliding with these. When the plasma had cooled sufficiently by the expansion of the universe, electrons and protons combined into H atoms. This event is still referred to as “recombination”, although cyclic models had lost support in the late 1990s, when an accelerated expansion suggested itself (within the Big Bang paradigm) in the redshift-magnitude relation of supernovae (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-22">Perlmutter, 2012</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-23">Riess, 2012</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-25">Schmidt, 2012</a>) instead of an expected decelerated one. Only after recombination and decoupling, when the charged particles had been neutralized, the photons could move freely.</p><p class="" id="d25188e221">It is now commonly estimated that the universe became transparent about 380,000 years after the Big Bang (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-26">Smoot, 2007</a>), when it had cooled to about 3000 K. The thermal radiation is said to have been emitted from a “last scattering surface” (LSS) and to have retained its blackbody spectrum because it expanded adiabatically. Due to the ever continuing expansion, which uses to be ascribed to “space”, the light waves were stretched and their energy density decreased. The wavelength at which the radiation is strongest, which according to Wien’s displacement law is inversely proportional to temperature, would have become roughly 1100 times longer since the radiation was emitted (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-6">Bennet <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>), while the temperature decreased to the present 2.7 K. Since the 1970s, the presence of this radiation has routinely been advanced as the strongest piece of evidence for a hot Big Bang.</p><p class="" id="d25188e233">The idea that the CMB comes directly, although redshifted, from a last scattering surface emerged only after 1965. It is not clear how the early followers of <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-30">Tolman (1934)</a> thought about this, but it requires normally a confinement in order to keep blackbody radiation within a region, and the questions of what constitutes or substitutes the confinement of an expanding universe and which difference the motion or absence of a boundary surface would make were not treated critically. The problem we are concerned with here arose at the latest when these questions were still not treated critically when the assumption of a directly viewed LSS had made them crucial.</p></div>
        <div id="article1-body" class="generated-article-body"><h2 class="main-title" id="d25188e242">The problem</h2><p class="" id="d25188e245">If one considers the following question, one can easily see that Big Bang cosmology requires the universe to be suitably confined or curved in order for radiation from the LSS to become visible at all.</p><p class="" id="d25188e248">If the CMB originated at the last scattering surface and all matter originated within the region enclosed by this surface, while light escaped from there at <i>c</i>, maintaining this velocity for eons, and the matter of which we consist left the same region more slowly, then, how can it be that we can see the light?</p><p class="" id="d25188e254">In order to see an event, the observer needs to be in a place where the light from the event has not yet passed, but with the stated premises, we cannot reasonably be ahead of the light. The ‘flash’ of light from the LSS had a substantial duration, but it must have passed our place very long ago. Now, it could only become visible at our place if the light had been reflected back to us or taken a curved return path of the right length. In a model, this needs to be specified. Before turning to the standard model, which will be shown to be inconsistent, let us first consider a non-reflective “flat” model and then briefly also reflective versions and a positively curved model.</p><p class="" id="d25188e257"><i>Model 1.</i> In a non-reflective flat Big Bang model (curvature 0), light will escape from the expanding material universe and proceed farther at velocity <i>c.</i> The material universe will be surrounded by an expanding empty region inside a spherical shell that contains radiation, perhaps also cosmic rays, but no ordinary matter. In such a universe, the conditions assumed by <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-29">Tolman (1931)</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-30">Tolman (1934)</a> and presupposed by his followers are not permanently retained after last scattering. However, the belief that radiation from a past epoch, named “relic radiation” or “residual radiation”, could permanently fill the whole volume of an expanding, formerly smaller universe even in the absence of a reflective boundary surface or a suitable “curvature” was inherent in the reasoning by <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-2">Alpher &amp; Herman (1948)</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-1">Alpher <i>et al.</i> (1967)</a> and <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-12">Dicke <i>et al</i>. (1965)</a>, and it has remained so in the more recent literature, e.g. <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-20">Peebles <i>et al.</i> (1991)</a> and <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-19">Peebles (1993)</a>. <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-3">Alpher &amp; Herman (1975)</a> described their expanding universe in retrospect as “<i>one containing a homogeneous, isotropic mixture of matter and blackbody radiation</i>”. This can and should be read as a warning against uncritical adoption, since the authors did not reason about how such a state could maintain itself over time, given the speed difference between radiation and matter. <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-12">Dicke <i>et al</i>. (1965)</a> stated that “<i>The radiation temperature would vary inversely as the expansion parameter (radius) of the universe</i>”. Their calculation presupposes the radiation to fill their expanding universe permanently. Likewise, <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-20">Peebles <i>et al</i>. (1991)</a> wrote: “<i>In the standard model, … space was (and is) filled with black-body radiation, the cosmic background radiation</i>”, but the “<i>(and is)</i>” qualifies as a non-sequitur. Correctly and transparently reasoned, radiation from a past epoch fills, at each instant, only the volume that is traversed by the rays or “future light cone” from that epoch.</p><p class="" id="d25188e325">For an origin at the LSS and no reflection, this volume is represented by the golden V-shaped band in <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#f1">Figure 1</a>. The band stands for a radiation-filled shell whose thickness remains, in comoving units, constant and equal to the diameter of the LSS. The shell surrounds an expanding volume that contains no such radiation. In such a universe, the LSS will no longer be visible to anybody who has moved at <i>v</i> &lt;&lt; <i>c</i> when more time has passed than what light needed for crossing the universe just after it had become transparent (the vertical width of the golden bands in <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#f1">Figure 1</a>). The actual CMB we see now thus could not possibly have originated there.</p></div>
        <div id="article1-body" class="generated-article-body"><h2 class="main-title" id="d25188e807">Discussion</h2><p class="" id="d25188e810">Because of the inherent inconsistency of the standard ΛCDM concordance cosmology, here represented by model 4, it does not come as a surprise that “<i>misconceptions and confusions have long been common in papers on cosmology, also in many by renowned authors</i>”, as reported by <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-8">Davis &amp; Lineweaver (2004)</a>. These authors deserve credit for having paid attention to those. However, they did not either notice that early events cannot be seen directly. In proceeding without considering reflections (last passage of their section 3.3), they mistook the intersection between our past light cone and the future light cone of the LSS [where a reflection would need to occur] for “<i>the points from which the CMB was emitted</i>” (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-8">Davis &amp; Lineweaver, 2004</a>, p. 101). Although this is not yet beyond the particle horizon of the Big Bang, it would still be off target by half as much as model 4. The confusion arose by equating this particle horizon with the surface of last scattering, which the authors refer to as “<i>our effective particle horizon</i>” (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-8">Davis &amp; Lineweaver, 2004</a>). It also disagrees with the caption of their Figure 1, which presupposes model 4 as such.</p><p class="" id="d25188e832">When <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-29">Tolman (1931)</a> considered “<i>the highly idealized model of a non-static universe filled with black-body radiation as a thermodynamic fluid</i>”, he did not discuss the implications of the large size of the universe and the possible absence of a reflective confinement or its equivalent. It deserves to be noted that the time required for cavity radiation to attain a desired degree of homogeneity (after a sufficient number of reflections) increases in proportion to the linear size of the cavity. In a Big Bang universe, this will even with modest demands take much longer than its age. If there is no boundary surface other than one that recedes at <i>c</i>, we have seen that any old radiation will eventually disappear from view. In a flat and non-reflective Big Bang universe [model 1 above and its equivalent in model 4 before being supplemented], this must happen to the radiation from the original LSS, which, thus, cannot remain visible. The CMB must have a different source, whose identification exceeds the scope of this article.</p><p class="" id="d25188e844">It is futile to consider whether the cosmic inflation theory (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-60">Guth, 1981</a>) might solve the homogeneity problem, because the process this theory postulates is terminated long before recombination. In the present article, the homogeneity at the stage of recombination in a Big Bang universe is not put into question. Instead, it is pointed out that homogeneity will be lost <i>thereafter</i>, irrespective of anything that might happen before.</p><p class="" id="d25188e853">While the irrationality of the assumption about the visibility of radiation from a past epoch in a Big Bang universe, which was disclosed in <i>The problem</i>, can be clearly seen in a spacetime diagram such as <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#f1">Figure 1</a>, it may be missed if the ordinary coordinates of time and distance are used, especially if a past light cone is shown (in these coordinates shaped like an avocado seed) that continues below <i>t</i> = 1.7 Gyr down to the origin, while it is not made evident that the region it traverses there lies outside the Big Bang universe. For examples see the “avocado seeds” in <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-8">Davis &amp; Lineweaver (2004)</a>, more detailed in <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://people.virginia.edu/~dmw8f/astr5630/Topic16/t16_light_cones.html" id="d25188e867">Whittle</a> and without any scale under “Manipulating Space-Time Diagrams” in <a target="xrefwindow" href="http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/cosmo_03.htm" id="d25188e871">Wright</a>.</p><p class="" id="d25188e876">The fact that the irrationality has remained unnoticed by professionals is an instance of the ordinary uncritical passing down of human culture, of languages, myths, etc. from generation to generation. In this wider cultural context, science stands out as an exceptional, more critical endeavor that requires practitioners not simply to accept and adopt what they were taught, but to check the relevant assumptions and doctrines for consistency and tenability and to recheck them when premises and/or relevant knowledge change. This may sometimes fail to happen, especially in cases like this, where the presence of an inconsistency became potentially clear only gradually, here after 1965, when a teaching practice had already established itself since <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-30">Tolman (1934)</a>. This practice appears to have prevented the disclosure of the irrationality, which would likely have become obvious after a fresh look at the facts. It is in line with this and with <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-33">Lakatos’ (1976)</a> analysis of research programs that the rejection of the idea of a Big Bang has been blocked in model 4, although the evidence that requires the rejection has been accepted. Blockage of this kind tends to foster more or less absurd speculation. While scientific journals often tolerate speculative ideas like “inflation” and the “multiverse”, which have been left out of consideration here, it is unfortunate that most of them refuse through prejudice to publish any paper that discredits the “hard core” (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-33">Lakatos, 1976</a>) of the currently accepted doctrine within their field from inside. For editors, it is rational to reject such papers right away: these might threat their reputation if later shown to be erroneous. Also for reviewers who lack a critical attitude against the established practice and doctrine, it is a priori inconceivable that the whole community of well-educated professionals, here mainstream cosmologists, could have made the same cardinal blunder. This holds also in cases like this one, in which the presence of at least one inconsistency is obvious to the uncommitted.</p><p class="" id="d25188e888">Although the deficiencies disclosed here can be judged as completely unacceptable, other ones need to be addressed as well (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-14">López-Corredoira, 2017</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-16">Merritt, 2017</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-27">Spergel, 2015</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-31">Traunmüller, 2014</a>; <a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-32">Traunmüller, 2018</a>). Just consider that both Λ (dark energy) and CDM (cold dark matter) have remained in the imaginary realm and so merely represent mythical factors or immunizing tactics (also called “conventionalist stratagems”) that protect a doctrine from empirical falsification (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-16">Merritt, 2017</a>). Approaches that rely on such factors are excessively speculative, but inconsistencies such as the two revealed here must be desisted from in any discipline that is meant to qualify as rational. Within standard Big Bang cosmology, there is at least one additional inconsistency that is similarly serious. It is well-known that in this cosmology, any coherent and gravitationally bound objects up to the size of galaxy clusters are exempt from expansion. Only the voids between these clusters are free to expand (Traunmüller, 2018). Under this premise, the matter density within the universe could never have been higher than it uses to be within galaxy clusters – never as high as assumed during the alleged epoch of last scattering. I am not aware of an excuse for this, but suggesting some fancy new physics that might hide inconsistencies is not the preferable way. One should first look for and correct old mistakes that might cause the inconsistencies. One should strive for well-foundedness in the physical principles (<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/9-261#ref-32">Traunmüller, 2018</a>) rather than merely for a rationalized mythology, but it is, of course, even more fundamental to respect reason at all.</p></div>
